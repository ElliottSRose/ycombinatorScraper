# ycombinatorScraper
This program will pull the first 30 entries from ycombinator, creating an objects that keep the order-number, points, comments, title, and the title length for each one. These are all then collected into and stored in a list. Finally two filter and sorting functions will be applied:

Entries with more than five words in the title ordered by the number of comments first.
Entries with less than or equal to five words in the title ordered by points.
